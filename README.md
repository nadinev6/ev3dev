### Gears

Gears is an online 3D EV3 simulator developed by the company A Posteriori.
It uses blockly, Google's block-based coding language, a visual programming language very similar to scratch
It also has an editor plugin with a python library that translates block code to python.

Gearsbot allows you to configure a robot, It also automatically imports the associated library to your python file automatically. You can build a fully customisable simulated world. There is a virtual arena with a grid map that can be manipulated to your specifications.
