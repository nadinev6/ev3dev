### Gears

Gears is an online 3D EV3 simulator developed by the company *A Posteriori*.

![picture alt](https://img.icons8.com/fluent/48/000000/blockly-green.png "Blocks editor") It uses blocks,  a visual programming language.

It also has an editor plugin with a python library that translates block code to python.



Gearsbot allows you to configure a robot and imports the associated library to your python file automatically.

You can build a fully customisable simulated world.

There is a virtual arena with a grid map that can be manipulated to your specifications.
